              Canada. I am passionate about problem-solving and ready to take on
              any challenge that tests my skills in computer science, math and
              more...

              In the future, I see myself researching new technologies from
              Artificial Intelligence to Quantum Computers. In my free time, I
              do Web development, bot automation and sometimes (hehehe not
              always ðŸ˜‚) workout!!
